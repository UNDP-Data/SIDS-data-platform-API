{"developmentContext": {"title": "Development Context", "content": "<p>The Kingdom of Tonga is an archipelago consisting of four clusters of 176 total islands, 36 of which are inhabited, south of Samoa, southeast of Fiji and northeast of New Zealand; with a population of 104,494 people. Tonga is a constitutional monarchy and is unique among Pacific nations for having maintained its independence from colonial powers. Tonga is a lower middle-income country with reasonable health and education status, although rates of poverty and inequality are rising amongst the most vulnerable groups. Tonga is reliant on external income through development assistance, loans, and overseas remittances from the large Tongan diaspora. Tonga lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of dynamic geological activity. It is ranked the second most vulnerable country to natural hazards (after Vanuatu).\u00a0Encircled by fringing reefs, most of the islands in Tonga originate from coralline. The majority of these islands are comparatively flat except for those raised by tectonic action. The country is predominantly rural, with around 25% of the population living in urban areas.</p><p>Environmental changes in Tonga\u2019s coastal zones include land loss, shoreline retreat, reduced beach vegetation (including mangroves) which would otherwise act as buffers against the impacts of climate change. Much of the infrastructure and socio-economic activities in Tonga are located near or on the coast which makes them highly vulnerable to effects of sea-level rise. This has a significant impact on the country\u2019s GDP and development in general. Water infrastructure in particular is essential to the well-being of the residents, and needs to be addressed.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Tonga\u2019s HDI value for 2019 is 0.725\u2014 which put the country in the high human development category\u2014 positioning it at 104 out of 189 countries and territories. Between 1990 and 2019, Tonga\u2019s HDI value increased from 0.654 to 0.725, an increase of 10.9 percent. Between 1990 and 2019, Tonga\u2019s life expectancy at birth increased by 2.0 years, mean years of schooling increased by 2.9 years and expected years of schooling increased by 0.8 years. Tonga\u2019s GNI per capita increased by about 50.9 percent between 1990 and 2019.</p><p>Tonga has mainstreamed the MDGs into national policies. Fiji, Tonga and Tuvalu have also improved and strengthened data systems and Tuvalu has included monitoring of vulnerable groups at the community level while the Solomon Islands has established a Development Assistance Database for improved information collection, tracking, analysis and planning services for development funds. </p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>The multiple effects of climate change pose a significant threat to the islands of Tonga, which is particularly vulnerable to storm surges and tsunami inundation. Some of Tonga\u2019s adaptation projects include: public awareness programmes, coastal revegetation, coastal protection, expansion of water collection systems and agroforestry.</p><p>Tonga\u2019s economy base is small, and is mainly comprised of climate-sensitive sectors such agriculture and fisheries. The country is also dependent on foreign aid. Coastal resources such as marine fisheries are vital to livelihoods of Tongans. Coral reefs, mangroves and beaches are the main environmental components of the coast which are under threat from the effects of climate change. The combination of coastal developments such as the mining of beach sand, sea level rise and extreme events caused by climate change, have led to coastal degradation.  Groundwater supplies are subject to salt-water intrusion as a result of increasing sea levels. Records suggest that there has been a general increase in sea level of 14mm/yr between 1993 and 2001. The rise in mean sea level combined with extreme weather events is likely to contribute to an increase in inundation of low-lying areas.</p><p>Tonga has a mixed record on promoting gender equality and has not ratified The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Women\u2019s political participation is limited, with three women national Members of Parliament. Women\u2019s work force participation is highest in the informal sector. Two out of three women report experiencing gender-based violence. In Tonga, 7.4 percent of parliamentary seats are held by women, and 94.0 percent of adult women have reached at least a secondary level of education compared to 93.4 percent of their male counterparts. Female participation in the labour market is 45.7 percent compared to 74.3 for men.</p><p><strong>////////////////////////////Compiled Content////////////////////////////////</strong></p><p><strong>TONGA</strong></p><p><strong>UNDP in Tonga</strong></p><p><strong>Inclusive service delivery</strong></p><p>We help countries address a range of policy and institutional bottlenecks to ensure more inclusive service delivery, focusing on issues facing women, youth and vulnerable groups. We draw on our comparative advantage and experiences in supporting the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals Acceleration Frameworks to support localization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 1, 5, 8, 10 and 17. At the country level, we target the alignment of national and sectoral plans and multi-year results-based budgets, exploring all potential sources of revenue through development finance assessment aimed at optimizing and increasing the collection and use of finance for national priorities.</p><p><strong>Innovation</strong></p><p>We assist the countries in identifying innovative technological solutions to build national data ecosystems for evidence-based policymaking using disaggregated data. We work closely with the United Nations and regional partners engaged in data generation, such as UNFPA, UNICEF and the Pacific Community, through national and sample surveys. The data is used to track progress towards national priorities and their links to regional and global development priorities, identify groups to target and analyse and formulate evidence-based policy formulation and SDG Acceleration Frameworks.</p><p><strong>Triangular and south-south cooperation\u00a0</strong></p><p>In keeping with Goal 17, the support fosters South-South and Triangular Cooperation and implementation of the Pacific SDG Roadmap, the Framework for Pacific Regionalism, the SAMOA Pathway and other regional and international instruments and partnership mechanisms.\u00a0<br /><br />We work with regional organizations, governments, private sector, civil society and United Nations partners to strengthen institutional arrangements and change behaviours to promote equal influence and participation of women and youth in priority-setting and implementation of activities at all levels. Countries are encouraged to establish measures that ensure the consistent engagement of communities in rural areas and outer islands, faith-based groups and the private sector in the design and delivery of essential public services. As part of an integrated, risk informed development approach, we help countries and communities integrate risk assessment and adaptation measures into planning processes at all levels to address vulnerabilities.</p><p><strong>Promote blue economies</strong></p><p>Responding to the changing face of poverty and hardship in the Pacific, we promote the concept of blue/green economies to help countries establish an enabling environment for private sector initiatives that create jobs for women, men and youth, recognizing the vast economic benefits of marine and land ecosystems while ensuring their sustainable management. To that end, we scale up successful initiatives such as organic farming, fisheries, ecotourism and farm-to-table business models, especially targeting marginalized urban youth. Building on past support to the informal sector, we promote opportunities for employment, incomes and matching investment in social enterprises that tackle community-based improvement projects such as resilient village infrastructure and waste management. To promote access to finance, we scale up a range of inclusive financial services targeting low income women and men in rural areas.</p><p><strong>Human Development Report 2020</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/TON#\">https://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/TON#</a></p><p><strong>SDG progress profile</strong><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/UNSDG/countryprofiles/ton#goal-15\"><strong> https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/UNSDG/countryprofiles/ton#goal-15</strong></a></p><p><strong>0.960 GENDER DEVELOPMENT INDEX Tonga (2017)</strong></p><p><strong>The proportion of land area covered by forest was 12.4 % in 2020.
