Coastal zones also include highly important ecosystems for the breeding and feeding of various species. The tropical rainforest in Suriname is one of the important natural resources, covering approximately 91 percent or 15 million hectares of the total land area, of which about 2 million hectares or 13% has the status of Protected Areas.</p><p>Before the recession, Suriname’s economic growth was fuelled by high commodity prices for gold, lumber, oil and bauxite and higher remittances. Its gross domestic product (GDP) is approximately $9.9 billion. The industrial base of Suriname is dominated by the mining and petroleum industries. To a lesser extent, the agricultural and tourism sectors also contribute to the country’s GDP.
