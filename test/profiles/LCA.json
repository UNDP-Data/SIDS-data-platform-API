Saint Lucia has a relatively high level of biological and ecosystem diversity. The island’s reef systems extend along its west and east coasts, with the healthiest and most diverse reefs being found along the central west coast. </p><p>Population centres and economic activities, including tourism, are concentrated along the coast. The economy of Saint Lucia is dominated by tourism and banana production, with some activity from small-scale manufacturing. Tourism’s direct contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 15.61 percent (2018) increases by 2.71 percent on a year-on-year average. </p><p>In Saint Lucia, 1.9 percent of the population are multidimensionally poor. As a SIDS, with significant vulnerabilities to external economic shocks, the impacts of natural disasters and effects of climate change, Saint Lucia recognizes fully that sustainable development with a focus on people, planet, prosperity, partnerships and peace has to be at the core of national plans and programmes, in order to meet the needs of present and future generations. </p><p>Saint Lucia’s National Coordination Mechanism for the 2030 Agenda continues to strengthen policy coherence and policy integration at the national level, including through recent collaboration and assistance from the United Nations Development System (UNDS); however fundamental challenges that limit effective implementation, monitoring and review of the SDGs persist.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Saint Lucia’s HDI value for 2019 is 0.759— which puts the country in the high human development category.

In 2019, 20.7 percent of parliamentary seats are held by women. Saint Lucia has made meaningful strides in the implementation of SDGs 3 and 4 on health and education.

Limits to adaptation include the inability of coastal ecosystems to adapt to increased sea level rise, insufficient financial resources to implement required adaptation strategies, and the lack of effective or affordable technology to provide coastal protection from sea level rise and other slow onset events and extreme events. Barriers are mainly related to institutional, financial, and policy obstacles. </p><p>Human, technological, and institutional capacity constraints also contribute to a particular set of challenges that retard Saint Lucia’s effective implementation of the SDGs.
