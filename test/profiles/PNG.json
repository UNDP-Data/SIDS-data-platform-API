With an annual population growth rate of 2.3 per cent, the population is projected to reach 9 million by 2020 and could double by 2050.  Eighty-five per cent of the population live in rural areas and seventy-five per cent of households depend on subsistence agriculture.</p><p>In economic terms, the country is rich in natural resources (forestry, agriculture, fisheries and minerals) and has vast natural ecosystems hosting a unique range of biodiversity.  PNG is ranked as a lower to middle income country with a gross national per capita income of US$2,386. The capital, Port Moresby, has a population of approximately 400,000.

The 2004 and 2009 National Millennium Development Goals Progress Reports however show mixed results and more generally, PNG has struggled to meet its own localized Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets; especially in maternal health, infant mortality, literacy and HiV/AIDs.</p><p>Despite increasing national wealth, human development outcomes continue to lag behind: PNG currently ranks 156 out of 187 countries on the Human Development Index (HDI).

Health indicators have declined in recent years due to the closure of many peripheral health facilities. By 2006, infant mortality had reached 57 per 1000 live births (64 in the year 2000) and maternal mortality was 733 per 100,000 live births (370 in 1996). The challenges of distance, isolation, lack of transport and an extreme shortage of skilled birth attendants, highlight the hazards of childbirth in PNG.</p><p>The rate of malnutrition is unacceptably high and remains a significant underlying factor for morbidity and mortality particularly for children under five years. Almost half of the children aged 6 – 59 months are stunted and about a third of women of child bearing age are anaemic.</p><p>Sexually transmitted infections (STI) rates are among the highest in the Pacific with total STI cases increasing from 21,213 in 2000 to over 71,000 in 2009 (a 235 per cent rise).</p><p>Gender equality is a significant challenge and systemic violations of women’s rights exist throughout the country.  PNG ranks in the bottom ten countries of the Gender Inequality Index.  Women and girls have substantially less access to health care and education services than men and boys.</p><p>Violence against children and women and gender-based violence is unacceptably high, experienced by an estimated two-thirds of women.  Women are vastly under-represented at all levels of government (less than 3 per cent in the National Parliament), limiting their power to influence public policy at all levels.</p><p>PNG is a source, destination, and transit country for men, women and children subjected to human trafficking (domestic and international), specially forced prostitution and forced labour.</p><p>Climate change and environmental degradation due to over-exploitation of natural resources, unsustainable land use, fishing practices, habitat destruction, pollution and poor environmental governance increases the vulnerability of PNG to natural hazards.  Between 1997 and 2010, 4 million people were affected by natural disasters, with damages estimated at around US$100 million.</p><p>Rural-urban drift, the proliferation of small arms, increasing urban crime and tribal fighting (often over land management) have created law and order problems that pose a challenge to the central authority.  Peace building, recovery and development in the fragmented post-conflict environment of Bougainville are also major challenges.</p><p>The mountainous terrain, scattered small islands and limited infrastructure (air is the only link between the capital and most provinces) present major development challenges, especially in terms of growing the economy and allowing access to national and international markets for produce.  PNG is generally a very expensive country for business which has resulted in the relatively limited engagement by international NGOs and civil society organizations, relative to the rest of the Pacific.</p><p>Successes</strong></p><p>PNG is a vibrant democracy with a free press and independent judiciary.

That said, retention in the basic education cycle remains a problem and the gender parity index for net enrolment rates declined from the previous year’s 1.02 per cent to 0.94 per cent, indicating persistent challenges in equality.</p><p>Due to the intense efforts of many actors, including faith-based and civil society organisations, the rapid upward trend in HIV prevalence, that peaked in 2005, has slowed down to a national rate of 0.9 per cent (2009), although this masks provincial pockets with a very high prevalence and a gender dimension.</p><p>In early 2013, the Government introduced a fee-free education policy up to Grade 9 to expand access to basic education as well as a free health care policy.</p><p> </p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": 62.8, "title": "Life expectancy at birth", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 75, "title": "Population dependent on subsistence agriculture", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 850, "title": "Indigenous languages spoke in the country", "unit": ""}, {"value": 40, "title": "Population living on less than $ 1/day", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 7, "title": "of the world's biodiversity", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 85, "title": "People living in rural areas", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 2712, "title": "Gross national income (GNI) per capita", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 12, "title": "Wage employment rate", "unit": "%"}]}
