Climatic features include relatively high and uniform temperatures throughout the year and steady easterly trade winds.

The marine and coastal ecosystems sustain Antigua &amp; Barbuda\u2019s sandy beaches and fisheries resources and protect against tropical storms and hurricane activity.

In addition, cruise tourism is a solid sub-sector, assuming an increasing tourism market share. The agriculture sector is also an essential part of the country\u2019s economy, with major crops including fish, cotton, livestock, vegetables and pineapples. </p><p>The Government of Antigua and Barbuda places a high priority on education and usually allocates the largest share of the Government\u2019s budget to education, recognizing that education is key to the advancement of its people and human capital development and the overall development competitiveness of the island nation.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s HDI value for 2019 is 0.778, putting the country in the high human development category.
