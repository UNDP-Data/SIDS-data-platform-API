This ratio is determined after dividing the average parcel shipping time by the standard shipping time expected for parcels delivery at the national or international level, and at the product level depending on data availability. An alternative way of computing a similar quality of service ratio would be to use the percentage of parcels actually delivered within the quality standard, i.e. within the standard for shipping times. The standard for shipping time is the expected end-to-end transit time and is often expressed as the posting day + one, two , three, four or five days depending on the country geography and distance between countries.", "name": "Freight loaded and unloaded, maritime transport (metric tons)", "source": "Source: UNCTAD Review of Maritime Transport, 2021 and UNCTADstat (https://unctadstat.unctad.org/wds/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=32363).", "dataset": "sdg", "category": "SDG 9", "subcategory": "Target 9.1", "link": "https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/", "dim": "None", "priority": "2.0", "units": "METONS"}}
