The indicator is calculated as the number of public service positions held by members of the target group divided by the total number of such positions. From OHCHR: Target groups should be identified at national level in an inclusive, participatory process, with the direct involvement of marginalised and minority groups themselves. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) has made clear that identification as a member of a particular ethnic group \\'shall, if no justification exists to the contrary, be based upon self-identification by the individual concerned.\\' This principle also applies to other population groups. Target groups may include persons with disabilities, ethnic groups, LGBTI persons, indigenous peoples, religious minorities, linguistic minorities, youth, older persons, or other groups under-represented in the national context. The indicator is calculated as the number of public service positions held by members of the target group divided by the total number of such positions.", "name": "Ratio of young members in parliament (Ratio of the proportion of young members in parliament (age 45 or below) in the proportion of the national population (age 45 or below)\u00a0with the age of eligibility as a lower bound boundary), Lower Chamber or Unicameral", "source": "Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), Parline Database", "dataset": "sdg", "category": "SDG 16", "subcategory": "Target 16.7", "link": "https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/", "dim": "<=45Y", "priority": "2.0", "units": "Ratio"}}
