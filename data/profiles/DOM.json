The country’s workforce is highly dependent on the services sector, being comprised of the tourism, transportation, communications and finances industries. </p><p>The institutional and normative framework of the Dominican democracy faces challenges to promote and guarantee social well-being and reduce conflicts. Women’s participation in elective positions is still low despite established quotas to ensure female representation and there is a high rate of gender-based violence. Social oversight is lacking, and the use of sustainability safeguards in the design of public policies, institutional reforms and transparency in public management is inadequate.</p><p>Like most countries in Latin America, the Dominican Republic has submitted one national communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) with a second one under preparation. Land use change and forestry are large contributors to GHG emissions within the sector. The emission reduction potential is large and several reforestation programs have been initiated. The Dominican Republic does not count with Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects in the agricultural sector, thus carbon trading opportunities can be explored. A greater emphasis on developing and applying adequate insurance mechanisms can be placed for better management of public resources in light of natural disasters in the agriculture sector.</p><p>On the adaptation side, the focus is on the potential to build resilience to climate and to increase the adaptive capacity through sustainable management of agriculture and other complementary factors (e.g. financial instruments).</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Dominican Republic’s HDI value for 2019 is 0.756— which put the country in the high human development category.

Between 1990 and 2019, the Dominican Republic’s life expectancy at birth increased by 7.5 years, mean years of schooling increased by 3.2 years and expected years of schooling increased by 2.7 years.

The Gini index has shown minimal distributive improvements that are not proportional to the high economic growth (falling 9.7 percent between 2000 and 2016). The 2015 Human Development Index (0.722) adjusted for inequality fell by 21.7 per cent. The main sources of inequality are in living standards (28.1 percent), education (19.9 percent) and health (16.8 percent). There are limitations in the labour market, particularly for youth and women: 47 percent of employed women work in the informal sector and receive incomes up to 39.4 percent lower than men. Moreover, agriculture is highly vulnerable to extreme weather events, this coupled with problems of land degradation in the country.  Threats associated with climate change, natural hazards (hydro-meteorological and seismic) and vulnerabilities linked to insularity aggravate the challenges associated with the unsustainable management of natural and water resources.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "88 941", "title": "GDP per capita (2021)", "unit": "million current US$"}, {"value": 5.1, "title": "GDP growth rate", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 0.72, "title": "Human Development Index (HDI) (2019)", "unit": ""}, {"value": 0.99, "title": "Gender Development Index (GDI) (2019)", "unit": ""}, {"value": 0.015, "title": "Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI)", "unit": ""}, {"value": 73.9, "title": "Life expectancy at birth", "unit": "years"}, {"value": 25.9, "title": "Infant Mortality Rate  ", "unit": "per 1000 births"}, {"value": 1.1, "title": "Population Growth Rate", "unit": "%"}]}
