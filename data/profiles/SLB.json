Another major challenge is the high cost and administrative difficulty of delivering services to a largely subsistence population dispersed across many islands with minimal infrastructure and expensive transport links. The majority of Solomon Islanders (approx. 85%) live in remote rural areas. Because of the geographic situation, they depend not only on energy supply and connectivity but also on climate change and the increasing frequency of natural disasters. </p><p>Solomon Islands&rsquo; women have had full suffrage since 1974 however, the country has only ever had three women Parliamentarians. The political marginalization of women contributes to women&#39;s undervaluing and the high rate of sexual and gender-based violence. Both are factors in the alienation of half population, weakening the social fabric essential for peace and stability. Young women face the double disadvantage of both social expectations of their age and their gender. Women have played an important role as advocates for peace, but their influence on decision-making processes limits that role.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "1193.5", "title": "GDP per capita", "unit": "usd"}, {"value": "0.53", "title": "Human Development Index", "unit": ""}, {"value": "2253.0", "title": "GNI per capita ", "unit": "constant 2017 PPP$) "}, {"value": "11.9", "title": "internet access/user", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "28.0", "title": "International Inbound Tourists", "unit": "thousands"}, {"value": "20.0", "title": "4G mobile network", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "90.0", "title": "land area covered by forest", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "2.1", "title": "Foreign direct investment, net inflows ", "unit": "(% of GDP)"}]}
