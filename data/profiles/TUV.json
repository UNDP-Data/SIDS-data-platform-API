The country rarely exceeds 3 metres above mean sea level. At its widest point, Tuvalu only spans about 200 meters. </p><p>Tuvalu is the fourth smallest nation in the world, comprising nine inhabited islands with a population of 10,640. With an average elevation of only 1.83 meters, it is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to the impacts of climate change.

Around three quarters of the labour force works in the informal economy, primarily subsistence farming and fishing. Most of the islands are built on coral and are not suitable for crop production beyond household needs. Underemployment, particularly of young people, is fuelling urbanisation of the capital, Funafuti.</p><p>Due to its low-lying geography, Tuvalu is at acute risk from natural disasters, including rising storm surges, cyclones, and tsunamis. Seawater infiltration has already increased soil salinity, limiting the range of plants that can be grown on the islands. Increased water temperatures and ocean acidification have affected coral ecosystems that serve as fish nurseries, making it harder for Tuvaluans to catch and eat fish. Groundwater resources are no longer suitable for human consumption due to pollution from saltwater intrusion. Coastal erosion is a major problem in Tuvalu, particularly on the western side of the islands. As most Tuvaluans live within coastal areas, additional stress is being placed on the already vulnerable marine ecosystem. Rising sea temperatures are also contributing to coral bleaching and decreasing marine productivity. The marine ecosystem is a vital component of Tuvalu\u2019s economy which is dependent on revenue provided by tuna fishing.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": 47.0, "title": "GDP per capita (2021)", "unit": "million current US$"}, {"value": 6.3, "title": "GDP growth rate", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 6.3, "title": "Seats held by women in national parliaments", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 108.7, "title": "Primary gross enrolment ratio", "unit": "per 1000 "}, {"value": 1.2, "title": "Population growth rate", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 19.0, "title": "Health: Current expenditure", "unit": "% of GDP"}, {"value": 12.0, "title": "International trade: exports", "unit": "million current US$"}, {"value": 33.3, "title": "Forested area\u00a0", "unit": "% of land area"}]}
