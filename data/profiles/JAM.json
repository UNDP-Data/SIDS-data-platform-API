"<p>Jamaica is an island in the Caribbean Sea. The island is 230 kilometers long and 80 kilometers wide, with a population of around 2.8 million; approximately 22 percent of its inhabitants live below the poverty line. About sixty percent of the island’s bedrock is white limestone; twenty five percent is volcanic and cretaceous, ten percent alluvial and five percent yellow limestone. More than 120 rivers flow from the mountains to the coast. The coastline is approximately 1,022 kilometers. </p><p>Jamaica is the largest English-speaking island in the Caribbean and the third-largest island in the Greater Antilles. It derives its name from Xaymaca, ‘Land of Wood and Water’. The capital city Kingston is home to over 571,000 people. As a small island developing state which is heavily reliant on its natural resources, Jamaica is also prone to a number of natural hazards, and the threats posed by these hazards are exacerbated by climate change. The country also faces challenges in the sustainable management of its environmental resources. </p><p>Jamaica’s economy is dependent on the services sector (including tourism), which constitutes approximately 60 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP); remittances make up a further 20 percent of the country’s GDP. Jamaica has a high unemployment rate and the fourth highest debt to GDP ratio per capita in the world. Approximately 65 percent of the country’s workforce is employed by the services sector, 17 percent by industry (bauxite, gypsum, etc.) and 18 percent in agriculture.</p><p>While the country is over 90 percent dependent on imported fossil fuels to meet its energy demands, resulting in relatively high costs reflected in the cost per KWh and in the amount of money that the country spends on energy, Jamaica’s attempts to explore renewable energy sources could be strengthened by helping to address financial and regulatory barriers. </p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Jamaica’s HDI value for 2019 is 0.734— which put the country in the high human development category.

Between 1990 and 2019, Jamaica’s life expectancy at birth increased by 1.3 years, mean years of schooling increased by 3.8 years and expected years of schooling increased by 1.9 years. Jamaica’s GNI per capita increased by about 30.0 percent between 1990 and 2019. The country's adult literacy rate is 87%. There is almost 100% enrollment in primary school and 93% enrollment in secondary schools. Infant mortality rates have improved to 20 per 1,000.

Jamaica’s development priorities are outlined in its Vision 2030 Jamaica: National Development Plan (NDP). The NDP is aligned with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and has full bipartisan support.

The nation has also grappled with high levels of crime, poverty, and unemployment.  </p><p>Jamaica is highly vulnerable to natural hazards, particularly hurricanes, floods, droughts and earthquakes. Therefore, the NDP proposes strengthening the policy and regulatory frameworks for disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and mitigation and ensuring their full integration into existing frameworks at the national and local levels.</p><p>According to the Jamaica Survey of Living Conditions (JSLC), the population living in poverty increased from 9.9 percent in 2007 to 19.9 percent in 2012. The JSLC also records a deepening of poverty between 2009 and 2010, as measured by the poverty gap index, indicating a worsening in the circumstances of the poor and an increase in inequality.&quot;</p><p>The country is impacted by extreme tropical weather events, including tropical waves, storms and hurricanes, particularly during the hurricane season from June to November. For the coastal zone there is a need for advanced planning to avoid worst impacts, assessments of need for modification of land use and implementation of identified land use guidelines, modification of building styles and codes, and a withdrawal of Government subsidies for development in high risk areas. In addition, there needs to be more structured coral reef management and greater support for research and environmental monitoring.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": 19.9, "title": "Poverty rate", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 9319, "title": "Gross national income (GNI) per capita", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 87, "title": "Literacy rate", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "~100", "title": "Enrollment in primary school", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 75.8, "title": "Life expectancy", "unit": "years"}, {"value": 93, "title": "Sustainable access to improved drinking water sources", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 87.3, "title": "National dept to GDP ratio", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 20, "title": "Infant mortality rates", "unit": "per 1,000"}]}
