Located approximately 1,100 miles off of the northeast of New Zealand's north island, the largest island is Viti Levu (10 429 km2), which covers 57% of the total area, and Vanua Levu covers 5 556 km2. Viti Levu is the center of politics and economy of Fiji, having Suva (the capital), Nadi (the center of tourism) and farming land for sugarcane as the major crop. Over 90% of the population, both rural and urban, can be considered coastal dwellers, where the vast majority of services, infrastructure, agricultural production and social centers are located. Fiji is one of the most economically developed countries in the Pacific Island realm due to abundance of forest, mineral and marine resources</p><p>Climate change is expected to affect the country’s coastal resources by way of raising temperatures in the marine environment and through sea level rise. As well there may be impacts on infrastructure caused by a potential increase in the frequency and intensity of cyclones and other tropical storms, as the country is prone to El Nino events. During the November–April wet season Fiji is normally traversed by tropical cyclones as it lies directly in their normal path. </p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Fiji’s HDI value for 2019 is 0.743— which put the country in the high human development category— positioning it at 93 out of 189 countries and territories.

Between 1990 and 2019, Fiji’s life expectancy at birth increased by 2.1 years, mean years of schooling increased by 2.5 years and expected years of schooling increased by 2.3 years.

Fiji has an informal social protection system (veiwekani), which helps provide basic needs to individuals and groups. However, high levels of internal and overseas migration and the transition from a subsistence to market-based economy are undermining traditional support systems. The Fijian economy has had a period of sustained growth, and is primarily reliant on tourism, overseas remittances, transport, and sugar exports. More than half of Fijians are employed in the informal sector, predominantly in agriculture, and there are high rates of youth unemployment. There has been a substantial increase in the ratio of the area protected for biological diversity (marine and terrestrial) to surface area and community-based marine protected areas. </p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>Fiji is affected by geographic isolation, ecological fragility, limited resources and a narrow economic base. It is vulnerable to climate change and disasters and exposed to external shocks, with some countries having experienced political instability, civil unrest and frequent changes of government. These wide-ranging economic, social, environmental and political challenges threaten its development and growth pathways, including achievement of the sustainable development goals. In addition, governments in the subregion often lack the resources and capacity to tackle these challenges. Most rely heavily on official development assistance, overseas remittances and imported goods.</p><p>Multidimensional poverty is high across many countries in the Pacific region due to geographic remoteness and lack of access to basic services. Environmental, social and economic factors, including limited land access and productive resources, have increased human mobility, including internal migration. Urbanization and the creation of informal settlements have led to new forms of hardship and scant access to public services.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "Less than 1/3", "title": "Women’s participation in the labour market is less than a third of total share of employment in Fiji", "unit": "#"}, {"value": "50.0", "title": "Internet users", "unit": "% of population"}, {"value": "67.4", "title": "Life expectancy at birth", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "29.9", "title": "Poverty rate", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "14.4", "title": "Expected years of schooling", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "2.4", "title": "Carbon dioxide emissions, production emissions per capita", "unit": "tons"}, {"value": "62.5", "title": "Skilled labour force", "unit": "% of labour force"}, {"value": "56.8", "title": "Urban population", "unit": "%"}]}
