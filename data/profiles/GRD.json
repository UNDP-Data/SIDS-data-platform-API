Approximately 3% of the land area is at sea level, and these include the main towns and many of the key socio-economic facilities. </p><p>There are a variety of coastal and marine resources in Grenada - coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangrove swamps, which have proven to be crucial in the formation and sustenance of other resources near-shore fisheries. </p><p>The largest age groups in Grenada are young adults (20-34, 26.2%). Economic activity in the country is dominated primarily by services (tourism and education) and agricultural production (nutmeg and cocoa). Furthermore, Grenada has a high unemployment rate, at nearly 25 per cent. </p><p>Over the past several decades, Grenada has been adversely affected by extreme weather events; two hurricanes in 2004 caused damage totalling approximately 2.5 times the country\u2019s annual Gross Domestic Product and damaged or destroyed 90 per cent of the island\u2019s buildings. </p><p>Grenada is rising up to embrace a new vision for a more resilient future.

The vision aims to leverage Grenada\u2019s strengths by way of its natural resources: agriculture, marine environments, and tourism, and double down on its vulnerability to environmental and external shocks.\u201d It will encourage digital upskilling and incentivise experimentation and innovation amongst its businesses and citizens. The recommendations for putting the vision into action are centred around creating an Innovation Hub, a multi-stakeholder initiative to stimulate an environment for Grenadians to exchange ideas on innovative solutions to local problems, prioritising those that focus on making the country climate-smart, sustainable, and digitally literate. The Innovation Hub would harness advancements in digital technologies and international expertise to address local challenges such as developing the blue economy and resilient climate agriculture while also aiming to create the tools and capacities of local businesses and people to respond to these challenges. </p><p>Whilst committed to achieving the 2030 agenda, Grenada is on a specific mission to end the scourge of Family Violence.

Extreme events experienced in the recent past are likely to become more intense and frequent in the future. One of the backbones of Grenada\u2019s economy, tourism is expected to suffer severe disruptions due to sea-level rise from the adverse effects of beach erosion, coastal land loss, inundation and flooding. </p><p>While Grenada has been active in formulating policies and strategies relating to adaptation and climate resilience over the years, there remain substantial gaps and challenges. On the national level, an integrated and strategic approach to adaptation plus performance monitoring systems and the prioritisation of activities is still lacking. Furthermore, the coordination between stakeholders and joint knowledge management on adaptation is weak. Currently, capacity is not sufficient to prepare large projects that will enable Grenada to access climate change finance internationally, nor has a National Implementing Entity for the Adaptation Fund been established. This has hampered the Government\u00b4s ability to acquire resources for urgent adaptation needs effectively. </p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": 16.9, "title": "Expected years of schooling", "unit": "Years"}, {"value": 110.0, "title": "Exports and imports", "unit": "% of GDP"}, {"value": 50.0, "title": "Forest Area", "unit": "% of total land area"}, {"value": 89.3, "title": "Ratio of female-to-male labor force participation rate", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 0.1, "title": "Mean area that is protected in marine sites important to biodiversity", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 60.0, "title": "Ocean Health Index: Clean Waters score (worst 0\u2013100 best)", "unit": "-"}, {"value": 34.5, "title": "Mean area that is protected in terrestrial sites important to biodiversity", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 14.0, "title": "The proportion of total government spending on essential education", "unit": "%"}]}
