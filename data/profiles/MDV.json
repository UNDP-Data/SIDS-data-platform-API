low-lying coral atolls located in the Indian Ocean southwest of the Indian subcontinent. The Multidimensional Poverty Index revealed that 28% of the population experienced poverty prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, which exacerbated inequalities between people living in the capital, Malé, and atoll islands, and between men and women. A third of the country’s population is foreigners from neighbouring countries, and 53% of the population living in Malé are migrants. </p><p>Climate change is an existential threat to the small coral islands that make up the Maldives.  Over 80 per cent of the land area of Maldives is less than one meter above mean sea level; as such, a sea level rise of even a meter would cause the loss of the entire land area of Maldives. Rising sea levels also threaten the scarce fresh water resources of Maldives. Saltwater intrusion is gradually encroaching into the islands’ small pockets or ‘lenses’ of fresh water underground.  The coral reefs surrounding the Maldives are at risk due to gradual warming of sea water (in addition to pollution from man-made sources). Given that these reefs support both the country’s tourism and fisheries  industries upon which the people depend almost exclusively, climate change is a profound threat to its very economic base. </p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Maldives is an upper-middle-income country, with a 2019 Human Development Index of 0.74, placing the country in the high human development category. Since 1990 mean years of schooling have increased by 3 years, life expectancy by 17.4 years and gross national income by 132 per cent. The population is projected to reach 568,362 by the end of 2021. High-end tourism is an engine of rapid economic growth, contributing to improvements in socioeconomic indicators, and economic growth averaged 5.1 per cent annually from 2000 to 2019. </p><p>Maldives has progressed on some Sustainable Development Goals including reduced poverty, improved health and well-being, and raised levels of education. The government’s quick response to the pandemic included provision of income support for vulnerable groups and micro, small and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) and establishment of emergency shelter and repatriation programmes to reduce the impact on migrants. As of September 2021, the country had vaccinated over 84 per cent of eligible populations, providing free vaccination for all migrants. It is working to revive primary health care service delivery with quality, equity and better access. </p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>Deep-rooted socioeconomic, structural and systemic vulnerabilities have undermined the inclusiveness, sustainability and resilience of development gains. Suboptimal economic diversification, the dominance of ‘enclave’ tourism offering limited employment and opportunities for locals to integrate into value chains, a weak environment for private sector growth and inadequate investments in human capital have hampered equitable development. Geographical dispersion limits opportunities for economies of scale, and providing services in the country’s outer islands is costly. Maldives is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change and faces existential threats from global warming, sea level rise and climate and geophysical hazards. Maldives relies heavily on imported fossil fuels. </p><p>COVID-19 has threatened to reverse the country’s progress towards poverty alleviation. It affected health and socioeconomic conditions, brought the tourism industry to a standstill, weakened the country’s economy and increased food insecurity due to global supply chain disruptions. The government relied on external borrowing to finance recovery efforts, leading to high levels of debt, and the economy contracted an unprecedented 29 per cent in 2020. This underscored the urgency of re-imagining tourism and diversifying the economy. COVID-19 also highlighted the need for more effective social protection and wealth distribution systems. </p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": 5642, "title": "GDP per capita (2021)", "unit": "million current US$"}, {"value": 8.2, "title": "Poverty Rate", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 0.74, "title": "Human Development Index (HDI) (2019)", "unit": ""}, {"value": 0.923, "title": "Gender Development Index (GDI) (2019)", "unit": ""}, {"value": 0.003, "title": "Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI)", "unit": ""}, {"value": 78.7, "title": "Life expectancy at birth", "unit": "years"}, {"value": 6.8, "title": "Infant Mortality Rate  ", "unit": "per 1000 births"}, {"value": 3.4, "title": "Population Growth Rate", "unit": "%"}]}
