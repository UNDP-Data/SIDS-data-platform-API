With a total land area of 340 km² and 84 kilometers of coastline, the nation consists of over 30 islands, inlets, and cays. The country’s climate is tropical and the terrain of its islands are volcanic and mountainous. The main island of Saint Vincent is characterized by rugged, mountainous terrain with valleys that drain to the narrow coastal area, as well as wet upland forests, numerous rivers, and fertile soils. The country is home to about 31,300 acres (12666.7 ha.) of tropical forests. VCT hosts key biodiversity areas that are considered the Caribbean Biodiversity Hot Spots identified by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund. </p><p>The country’s population is approximately 110,940, with adult literacy at 88.1 percent and per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) approximately US$18,100. The country’s economy is highly dependent on tourism and agricultural production; approximately 60 per cent of the workforce is employed by banana production, and the industry accounts for 50 per cent of the island nation’s exports. Offshore fisheries are also important and are predominantly small scale and artisanal. </p><p>Saint Vincent and the Grenadines focuses its development plans on being a country that is diverse, modern, internationally competitive and committed to the social development of its people and environmental sustainability. The country’s vision of “Improving the Quality of Life for All Vincentians” is built on the principle of putting people at the centre of its development and this is aligned with the SDGs and elaborated in the country’s National Economic and Social Development Plan (2013-2025).</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Saint Vincent and the Grenadines' HDI value for 2019 is 0.738— which puts the country in the high human development category. Between 1990 and 2019, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines' life expectancy at birth increased by 2.0 years, mean years of schooling increased by 1.2 years, expected years of schooling increased by 2.1 years, and the GNI per capita increased by about 96.2 percent. In 2001, the economy experienced real growth of 1.8 percent and continued to demonstrate positive real growth due to a positive spill-off from the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector as well as activities in the hotel and restaurant and construction sectors.</p><p>Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has shown its commitment to mitigating climate change by independently taking concrete measures to reduce its emissions, particularly through renewable energy and waste initiatives. The largest contributor to reducing emissions will be the installation of a geothermal electricity generation facility, which when operational will provide over 50% of the country’s electricity needs. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines intends to develop its GHG sinks through reforestation, afforestation, reduced deforestation and reduced forest degradation. </p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>The country is still grappling with the impacts of volcanic eruptions in April 2021. The geography, geology, and socio-economic circumstances of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines make it highly vulnerable to climate-related natural disasters. Due to its mountainous topography, most activities on the mainland are concentrated on the narrow, low-lying coastline, at risk to sea-level rise and coastal erosion while the landscape also adds risks of landslides and flash flooding. An increase in severe weather events will result in significant expenditures, which will further constrain Saint Vincent and the Grenadines’ social and economic growth. Furthermore, the government lacks financial and technical resources to address these challenges. With climate-related events already causing damage and loss, these projections have dire implications for agriculture, water availability, and the protection of public and tourism infrastructure if no meaningful action is taken.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": 14.1, "title": "Expected years of schooling", "unit": "Years"}, {"value": 12378, "title": "Gross national income (GNI) per capita ", "unit": "PPP$"}, {"value": 85.2, "title": "Exports and imports ", "unit": "% of GDP"}, {"value": 2, "title": "Carbon dioxide emissions, production emissions per capita ", "unit": "Tonnes"}, {"value": 69.2, "title": "Forest area", "unit": "(% of total land area"}, {"value": 97.2, "title": "Net primary enrollment rate ", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 2, "title": "Renewable energy", "unit": "(% of Total Final Energy Consumption"}, {"value": 2.6, "title": "Energy efficiency", "unit": "MJ per US$ PPP"}]}
