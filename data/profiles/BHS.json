comprises an archipelago spread over approximately 260,000 km2 of the Atlantic Ocean. The 2000 census gave a total of 303,069 persons. Some 60% of the population was under thirty years of age. The economy is built on tourism and services. Bahamians, like other island peoples, have historically had a close personal relationship with the land and the sea. Until the advent of modern tourism and banking industries, most Bahamians relied on the resources of both land and sea for survival. Hurricanes are regular occurrences in The Bahamas during the Atlantic hurricane season (June 1 to November 30). Storm surges may cause serious flooding.</p><p>The Bahamas is a hub for transshipment and shipping services. It has one of the highest numbers of registered ships in the world ‐ in particular, cruise ships that sail in the Caribbean. Other industries include oil bunkering, salt, rum, aragonite and pharmaceuticals. Because of its ship registries and heavy reliance on tourism, the Bahamas does not collect taxes on personal income or capital gains. Revenues are mainly generated from tariffs on imported goods, value added tax and property taxes, as well as from tourists who visit the country.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Bahamas’ HDI value for 2019 is 0.814— which put the country in the very high human development category. Between 2000 and 2019, Bahamas’ HDI value increased from 0.797 to 0.814, an increase of 2.1 percent. Between 1990 and 2019, Bahamas’ life expectancy at birth increased by 3.7 years, mean years of schooling increased by 0.5 years and expected years of schooling increased by 0.8 years.</p><p>Bahamas has a Gender Inequality Index value of 0.341, ranking it 77 out of 162 countries in the 2019 index.

The new ministry is comprised of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and the Disaster Reconstruction Authority (DRA), which work together to facilitate mitigation planning, community preparedness, public information-sharing and recovery coordination.</p><p>The Bahamas was the first government in the world to launch fully a digital central bank currency, leading  innovation along this digital frontier in digital central bank currencies.</p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>When considering climate change as it relates to The Bahamas it is important to note that the country is an archipelago of small islands, most of them uninhabited, and that more than 80% of the land surface is only a meter or less above mean sea level. The natural resources of the country are very limited. </p><p>Climate change presents new challenges due to the speed of the anticipated changes and the magnitude of the investments needed to adapt to predicted changes. In the case of some small islands, the only option may be retreat and abandonment of property. The do-nothing option or strategy is the one against which all other options may be compared. However, it is always the default option because other options are either not available or are not known. Across The Bahamas, no one option alone is likely to achieve the desired results of reducing vulnerability to climate change. Zoning practices based on vulnerability assessments, restricting types of development, prohibiting activities that exacerbate the impacts, and replacement and provision of increased security for settlements and infrastructure, are options that need to be considered. Costs associated with planned adaptation will be high but the cost of not acting will be measured directly in loss of life, loss of competitiveness in the tourism sector and often at the expense of the environment.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": 73.9, "title": "Life expectancy at birth", "unit": "years"}, {"value": 12.9, "title": "Expected years of schooling", "unit": "years"}, {"value": 33747, "title": "Gross national income (GNI) per capita", "unit": "constant 2017 PPP$"}, {"value": 66.8, "title": "Employment to population ratio", "unit": "% ages 15 and older"}, {"value": 32, "title": "Homicide rate", "unit": "per 100,000 people"}, {"value": 77.4, "title": "Exports and imports", "unit": "% of GDP"}, {"value": 85, "title": "Internet users, total", "unit": "$ of population"}, {"value": 4.7, "title": "Carbon dioxide emissions, production emissions per capita", "unit": "tonnes"}, {"value": 0.4, "title": "Total population", "unit": "millions"}]}
