It is an English-speaking country with close ties with the English-speaking Caribbean Islands. It is a low-lying state with a vulnerable coastal strip 77 km wide in the east and 26 km wide in the western Essequibo region. Ninety percent of the population resides in the coastal strip where the main urban centres and commercial activities are to be found. There is a wide range of geographic types with coastal, hilly sandy, highland, forested and savannah regions. The country can be divided into climatic regions ranging from dry (annual rainfall less than 1788 mm) to extremely wet (annual rainfall greater than 4100 mm). Economic activities are concentrated in services (&gt;50 percent of real gross domestic product (GDP)), agriculture (22.8 percent) and mining (10.6 per cent). Agricultural activities are concentrated in the non-forested low lying coastal plains, and mining in the vast biodiverse, forested hinterland (&gt;80 percent of intact forests).</p><p>Guyana, based on the 1994 national inventory, makes only a minor contribution to emissions of greenhouse gases. However, increases in the global mean temperatures could have significant impact, especially on the coastal plain and on activities including the dominant agriculture sector in Guyana. It has limited institutional and human capacities and an insufficient regulatory framework to effectively manage and transform the natural capital wealth. This has resulted in loss of opportunities to translate such wealth into economic and social gains.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Guyana advanced to lower-middle-income status and recorded an annual average growth rate of about 5 percent over the past decade.

Between  1990  and  2019,  Guyana’s life  expectancy  at  birth  increased  by  6.6  years,  mean  years  of  schooling  increased  by  1.7  years  and expected  years  of  schooling  increased  by  1.3  years.

Recent discovery of offshore oil in significant quantities has the potential to increase GDP tenfold.</p><p>During the last programme cycle, UNDP successfully strengthened capacities of State and civil society organizations to enable access to financial/business services for underprivileged groups, to promote civic participation in key political decision-making processes, and to make progress in sustainable natural resource management.
