Belize is a small Central American state with a long, low-lying coastline which is vulnerable to natural disasters through tropical cyclones and flooding. Three-quarters of its land is covered by forests that support fragile ecosystems. The country lies in the hurricane belt and, on average, is affected by a hurricane every three years. </p><p>Belize is an upper-middle-income country with a GDP per capita of $8,486 in 2014. Tourism, agriculture and fishery drive the country\u2019s economic growth. The country\u2019s agriculture sector generates 71 percent of its foreign exchange earnings and employs about 29 percent of its labor force. Key export crops include citrus, sugar, bananas and marine products (such as shrimp). However, Belize\u2019s largest source of foreign exchange is tourism\u2014a sector of the economy that the government has designated as being a priority for further development.</p><p>The Government of Belize prioritizes poverty reduction and sustainable human development within its long term development agenda. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1, \u201cEnd Poverty in all its forms everywhere,\u201d is the central point that anchors the other SDG pillars. This goal is aligned with other national development planning frameworks, including Horizon 2030\u2014the National Development Framework for Belize between 2010 and 2030\u2014and the newly endorsed Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy for Belize (GSDS) 2016-2020.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Belize\u2019s HDI value for 2019 is 0.716\u2014 which put the country in the high human development category.

Inequality is high, as seen by the increase in the GINI coefficient from 40 percent (2002) to 53.1 percent (2013). Poverty is increasing, and 2013 estimates suggested that 41 percent of the country's population lives below poverty. High levels of unemployment\u201410.2 percent in 2015\u2014exacerbate poverty, with women and youth disproportionately affected.

Nationwide, over 40 percent of out-of-school youth aged 15 to 24 are employed.</p><p>Poverty and poor institutional capacities undermine citizen security in Belize, particularly in urban centres. Belize has the fourth-highest homicide rate per capita worldwide, with 40 homicides for every 100,000 residents. The overall crime rate in Belize City increased in 2014. Furthermore, increased violence against women threatens women's safety, which is evidenced by the high demand for related legal assistance. Worsening crime rates and violence are eroding the quality of life for citizens and hampering the country's prospects for social and economic development. </p><p>Due to the country's reliance on natural capital\u2014and because a large segment of the population (52 percent) and businesses are concentrated along the coast\u2014Belize is vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
