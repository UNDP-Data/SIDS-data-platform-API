Within each map, the 10% and 25% of ocean areas with the highest and lowest human impacts, respectively, were identified. The number of times each grid cell was categorized as a high-impact area or a low-impact area was counted. This map shows grid cells that were identified in each category in 75-90% of the simulation runs (High/Low Impact Likely) and in over 90% of the simulation runs (High/Low Impact Very Likely). Data excluding climate change stressors is also available.", "title": "Lowest 10% Impacted Regions", "citation": "Stanford University (Stanford) University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Imperial College London (Imperial)", "units": "%", "dimension": "temp", "datasetCode": "humanImpactOceans"}
