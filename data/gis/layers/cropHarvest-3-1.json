The dataset was derived from the 2005 Spatial Production Allocation Model (SPAM). The SPAM model aimed to disaggregate (downscale) national and subnational crop statistics using a variety of inputs, such as cropland surface, location of irrigated areas, crop suitability and potential yields, rural population densities, production systems characteristics and crop prices. Crop data was downscaled to a spatial resolution of 5 arc minutes. This spatial resolution is approximately 10 kilometers x 10 kilometers at the equator, but changes with distance from the equator.", "title": "Global soya bean harvest", "citation": "International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). 2016. \"Global Spatially-Disaggregated Crop Production Statistics Data for 2005 Version 3.2.\" https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DHXBJX Add to Citavi project by DOI Harvard Dataverse, V9.
