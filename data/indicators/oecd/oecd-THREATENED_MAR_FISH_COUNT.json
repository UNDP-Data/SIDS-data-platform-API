Reporting the proportion of threatened species on The IUCN Red List is complicated by the fact that not all species groups have been fully evaluated, and also by the fact that some species have so little information available that they can only be assessed as Data Deficient (DD). For many of the incompletely evaluated groups, assessment efforts have focused on species that are likely to be threatened; therefore any percentage of threatened species reported for these groups would be heavily biased (i.e., the % threatened species would likely be an overestimate).", "name": "Threatened marine fish species (last available year), number", "source": "OECD Environment database - Threatened species</p><p> http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=WILD_LIFE </p><p>Accessed November 2020", "dataset": "oecd", "category": "Threatened marine species", "subcategory": "None", "link": "https://stats.oecd.org/", "dim": "None", "priority": "4.0", "units": "Number"}}
