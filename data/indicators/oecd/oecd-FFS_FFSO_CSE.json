The Inventory currently covers 36 OECD member countries and eight partner economies (Brazil, Colombia, China, India, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and South Africa) and has compiled more than 1 100 individual support measures (both active and terminated ones). In addition to national measures, subnational support measures for selected economies are also covered (i.e., Australia, Canada, China, Germany and the US).</p><p>For each measure two types of information are provided: (i) fiscal information on the budgetary transfers or tax expenditures (monetary value) and (ii) textual metadata about a measure\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beneficiaries, eligibility criteria, historical background, and any relevant data on procurement and processing information.</p><p>Following the OECD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PSE-CSE framework the measures benefitting fossil fuel producers are classified as the Producer Support Estimate (PSE) while those that benefit individual fossil fuel consumers are classified under the Consumer Support Estimate (CSE). A third category, the General Services Support Estimate (GSSE), is assigned for measures that do not currently increase fossil fuel production and consumption but may do so in the future.</p><p>The Inventory identifies the type of fossil fuels benefitted by each measure and presents a breakdown of the amount of support by assigning fuel type tags. In cases where this breakdown is not available in official government sources, the OECD performs data transformation procedure to allocate support to individual fuel tags according to the relative value of production or consumption as calculated from the IEA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s World Energy Balances database. Note that measures can benefit more than one type of fossil fuel at the same time and can thus receive multiple fuel tags in this respect. For example, a measure granting lower sales tax rates for road transport fuels will receive multiple fuel tags such as motor gasoline, diesel, LPG and natural gas.</p><p>Building on this methodology, an additional binary tag is developed for ocean-related government support for fossil fuels. </p><h4>Search strategy to identify ocean-related measures</h4><p>First, measures in countries not bounded by a coastline are removed (Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovak Republic and Switzerland).</p><p>Second, a keyword search is conducted on both the programme name and description to pre-screen measures and identify potential candidates for ocean-related FFS. The list of keywords includes generic ocean terms, keywords related to off-shore oil and gas, maritime transport, maritime fisheries and the ocean economy more broadly. See the following table for the full list. While entries in the programme name and description fields occasionally appear in their original language, all of these occurrences are consistently translated into English thus removing the necessity to devise foreign language keywords in the dictionary</p><p><strong>Keywords to identify a candidate subset of ocean-related FFS measures</strong></p><table><tr><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Search terms</th><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">ocean</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">marine</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">maritime</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">offshore</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">blue</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">reef</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">coral</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">deep-sea</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">deep-water</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea-bed</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">benthic</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">lagoon</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">mudflat</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">tidal</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">mangrove</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">coast*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">coastal</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">wetland</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">coastal</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">marshsalt</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">marsh</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">salt-water</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">brackish</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">fish*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">aquaculture</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">mariculture</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cod</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">tuna</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">coral*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">mussels</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">oysters</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">crustacean</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">mollusc</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">pelagic</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea-food</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">aquatic plants</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">ship*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">shipping</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">ship-building</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">boat</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">vessel</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">ferry</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">floating</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">naval</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">port</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea-port</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">harbour</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">harbor</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">dock</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea transport</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cargo</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">ballast</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">oil spill*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">oceanogra*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cruise</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">tour</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">touris*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">dredg*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea salt</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">desali*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">hurricane</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cyclone</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">typhoon</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">flood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">biotechnology</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">robotics</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">wave</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">underwater vehicle</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">continental shelf</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">EEZ</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">exclusive economic</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">arctic</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">piracy</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">submarine</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">undersea</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cable*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">seabed</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">hurricane</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cyclone</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">blue water</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cruise</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">international water*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">rig</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">territorial sea</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">high sea*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /></tr></table><p>Third, additional measures may be identified using the <em>sector</em> dimension which labels individual measures following the nomenclature used in the IEA World Energy Balances.
