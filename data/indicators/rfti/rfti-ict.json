Using, adopting and adapting frontier technologies requires sufficient ICT infrastructure, especially since AI, IoT, big data and blockchain are internet-based technologies. Two aspects of ICT infrastructure need to be considered: the prevalence to ensure that everyone has access and that no one is left behind; and the quality of infrastructure that allows for more advanced and efficient use. For these purposes, internet users as a percentage of the population captures the prevalence of internet infrastructure, while the mean download speed measures the quality of internet connection.", "name": "ICT ranking", "source": "UNCTAD Technology and Innovation Report 2021", "dataset": "unctad", "category": "Readiness for Frontier Technologies Index", "subcategory": "None", "link": "https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/tir2020_en.pdf", "dim": "None", "priority": "4.0", "units": "Index"}}
