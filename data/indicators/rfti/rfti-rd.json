R&D activities are measured using the number of publications and patents filed on the 11 frontier technologies in a country. The publication and patent search queries used are the same as shown in the Technical note in Annex B, the only difference being the year of interest \u2013 a single year for the index instead of 1996-2018. The countries of publication of authors and patent assignees were analysed. It should be noted that, especially in developing countries, there are informal R&D activities that do not result in a publication or patent so the R&D scores might not reflect the actual scale of activities.", "name": "R&D ranking", "source": "UNCTAD Technology and Innovation Report 2021", "dataset": "unctad", "category": "Readiness for Frontier Technologies Index", "subcategory": "None", "link": "https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/tir2020_en.pdf", "dim": "None", "priority": "4.0", "units": "Index"}}
