An extreme precipitation day is defined as a day where precipitation is greater than the 99th percentile precipitation compared to the baseline period. The data shown at each ten year interval represents a 31-year average, centered around the indicated year. For example, the number of extreme precipitation days in 2000 is actually an average of the annual number of extreme precipitation days between the years 1985 and 2015.", "title": "Projected Change in Extreme Precipitation Days", "citation": "Gassert, F., E.
