MHTs reflect groupings of ecoregions with similar biological, chemical, and physical characteristics. The MHTs refer to the dynamics of ecological systems and the broad habitat structures that define them. These groupings can provide a structured framework for examining and comparing the diversity of life in terrestrial systems.", "title": "Terrestrial Ecoregions", "citation": "The Nature Conservancy. 2019. \"tnc_terr_ecoregions.\" http://maps.tnc.org/gis_data.html.
