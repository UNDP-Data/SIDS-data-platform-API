The maps were generated with a random forest classifier that was trained using seven soil properties maps, thermal infrared imagery and the ECe point data from the WoSIS database. The validation accuracy of the resulting maps was in the range of 67\u201370%. The total area of salt affected lands by our assessment is around 1 billion hectares, with a clear increasing trend.", "title": "Global Soil Salinity Map 2016", "citation": "Batjes, N. H. (2009).
