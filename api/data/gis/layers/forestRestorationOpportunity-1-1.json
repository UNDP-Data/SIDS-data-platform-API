The dataset was created in 2011 based on current and historic forest extent data at a spatial resolution of 1 kilometer (km). It presents the results as three different forms of forest restoration: wide-scale, mosaic, and remote. Wide-scale restoration aims to restore closed forests (canopy density greater than 45%) in areas where they previously dominated the landscape.
