This data set is the aridity index (AI), which is calculated as the ratio of mean annual precipitation to mean annual potential evapotranspiration (PET), using data from the WorldClim Global Climate Database. The yearly precipitation values are available directly from the WorldClim database, and the PET values are derived from a selection of WorldClim variables.", "title": "Aridity", "citation": "Trabucco, Antonio; Zomer, Robert (2019): Global Aridity Index and Potential Evapotranspiration (ET0) Climate Database v2. figshare.
