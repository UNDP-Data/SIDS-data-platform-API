It is a combination of both satellite based datasets and agricultural inventory data from censuses. The dataset displays the percentage of land used for farming (cropland) and livestock (pasture area) for each grid cell. Each grid cell has a value of 0% to 100% coverage. A value of 0% means there are no agricultural activities present and 100% means the gridcell is completely used for cropland or pasture area. The dataset is displayed at a spatial resolution of 5 arc minutes (around 10 kilometers).", "title": "Cropland and Pasture Area", "citation": "Ramankutty, N., A.T. Evan, C. Monfreda, and J.A.
