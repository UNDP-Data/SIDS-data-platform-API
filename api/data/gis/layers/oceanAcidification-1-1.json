The aragonite saturation state (\u03a9arag) is commonly used to track ocean acidification because it is a measure of carbonate ion concentration, which indicates the availability of the calcium carbonate that is widely used by marine calcifiers, from lobsters to clams to starfish.", "title": "Projected Ocean Acidification", "citation": "van Hooidonk R, Maynard J, Manzello D, Planes S (2014) Opposite latitudinal gradients in projected ocean acidification and bleaching impacts on coral reefs.
