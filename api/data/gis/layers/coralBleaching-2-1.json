The dataset relies on a thermal stress model that uses the units degree heating months (DHM) to determine risk of bleaching. A water temperature rise of 2 degrees celsius is equal to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Bleaching Alert Level 2, where bleaching will likely occur. The final dataset is presented at a gridded spatial resolution of 50 km and shows the number of years each grid cell will reach a DHM of at least 2 during the decade.", "title": "Future Thermal Stress (2050s)", "citation": "Donner, S.D. 2009. \"Coping with Commitment: Projected thermal stress on coral reefs under different future scenarios.\" PLoS ONE 4(6): e5712.Accessed through Resource Watch, (26 April, 2022). www.resourcewatch.org.", "dataType": "Numeric", "units": "categorical"}
