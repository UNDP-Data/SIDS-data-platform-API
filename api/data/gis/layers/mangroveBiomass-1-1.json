(2012) to generate a pantropical map of aboveground live woody biomass density at 30 m resolution for the year 2000. The statistical relationship derived from ground-based measurements of forest biomass density and collocated Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) LiDAR waveform metrics, as described by Baccini et al. (2012), was used to estimate the biomass density of more than 40,000 GLAS footprints throughout the tropics.", "title": "Aboveground Live Woody Biomass Density", "citation": "Baccini, A., Walker, W., Carvalho, L., Farina, M., & Houghton, R.
