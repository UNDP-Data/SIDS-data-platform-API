The dataset relies on a thermal stress model that uses the units degree heating months (DHM) to determine risk of bleaching. A water temperature rise of 2 degrees celsius is equal to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Bleaching Alert Level 2, where bleaching will likely occur. The final dataset is presented at a gridded spatial resolution of 50 km and shows the number of years each grid cell will reach a DHM of at least 2 during the decade.", "title": "Future Thermal Stress (2030s)", "citation": "WRI. 2011. \"Frequency of Future Coral Bleaching Effects in the 2030s and 2050s.\" World Resources Institute. http://www.wri.org/resource/frequency-future-coral-reef-bleaching-events-2030s-and-2050s.
