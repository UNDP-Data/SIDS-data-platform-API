Agricultural crop yield is the amount of crop harvested per area of land. It is used to measure a crop\u2019s performance. This study used approximately 1.8 million agricultural census reports from 13,500 political units around the world to determine how crop yield changed over time. The dataset is presented at a spatial resolution of 5 arc minutes, which is approximately 10 kilometers x 10 kilometers at the equator, but changes with distance from the equator.\u201d", "title": "Categorical wheat", "citation": "The Maize, Rice, Soybean, and Wheat Yield Trends dataset shows the average annual change in crop yield from 1989-2008.
