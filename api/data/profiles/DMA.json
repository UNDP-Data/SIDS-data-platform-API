villages. </p><p>Dominica is volcanic in origin and is characterized by very rugged and steep terrain with approximately ninety miles of coastline. The country is known as the ‘Nature Isle of the Caribbean’ and is lush with rivers and rainforests and home to an expansive array of flora and fauna. </p><p>The country’s main economic sectors are</p><ul><li>rain-fed agriculture,</li><li>government services,</li><li>banks and insurance,</li><li>wholesale and retail trade, and</li><li>transport.</li></ul><p>Agricultural production accounted for 12.2% of total Gross Domestic Product (GDP). With GDP standing at US$517million, the Dominica economy reflects many of the traditional features of a small open economy. The open economy includes a high level of dependence on external trade, reliance on single sector export products (in agriculture), tourism revenue, and dependence on foreign capital for investment into productive sectors and infrastructural development.</p><p>Dominica is on its way to becoming the first climate-resilient nation in the world. An extensive national protected areas system constitutes a significant carbon sink and protects approximately 20% of the national territory. In addition, the island is moving towards ecotourism, as it markets its unique environment and culture. </p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Dominica's HDI value for 2019 is 0.742— which puts the country in the high human development category. Between 1990 and 2019, Dominica's life expectancy at birth increased by 2.6 years, mean years of schooling increased by 0.4 years, and GNI per capita increased by about 53.5 per cent.</p><p>Dominica has established a strong track record on climate change adaptation and, in this regard, was one of the first countries in the Caribbean region to adopt a National Climate Change Adaptation Policy. Dominica's national priority is to enhance community, ecosystem and national resilience to climate change and natural disasters. This includes implementing viable, sustainable energy and other mitigation measures, which reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels while building capacity and self-sufficiency—in this regard, harnessing the country's geothermal resources over the next decade. As a result, it will liberate considerable resources spent on fuel imports which can be redirected to priority adaptation measures to build resilience in vulnerable communities and sectors. Furthermore, the continued expansion of Dominica's geothermal resources from 2025 onwards will enable the country to export significant amounts of renewable energy to nearby countries, contributing to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emission ure. </p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>The island is in a vulnerable position economically, socially, culturally, and environmentally. Economic development, in particular, is significantly affected by both natural and man-made external factors, as is increasingly evidenced by the negative impact on the local economy of changes associated with such international phenomena as globalization and trade liberalization. </p><p>Dominica is vulnerable to current and ongoing impacts from climate change. Much of Dominica's essential infrastructures are located along the coastline, close to the present sea level; this makes them vulnerable to flooding and storms. Furthermore, 90% of the population is dispersed among coastal villages, with the main population centre, Roseau, located along the leeward coast. Temperature changes due to climate change affect a range of species, water flow in watersheds, reduced food availability for wildlife and increased forest pests, disease and vulnerability to extreme climate events. </p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": 1.934403912, "title": "Carbon dioxide emissions per capita (production) (tonnes)", "year": 2021, "unit": "tonnes", "indicator": "hdr-co2_prod"}, {"value": 13.3191862, "title": "Expected Years of Schooling (years)", "year": 2021, "unit": "Years", "indicator": "hdr-eys"}, {"value": 11487.62422, "title": "Gross National Income Per Capita (2017 PPP$)", "year": 2021, "unit": "2017 PPP$", "indicator": "hdr-gnipc"}, {"value": 110.193278502552, "title": "Trade (% of GDP)", "year": 2020, "unit": "% of GDP", "indicator": "key-wdi2-NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS"}, {"value": 30.88584, "title": "Protected marine area (Exclusive Economic Zones) (square kilometres)", "year": 2021, "unit": "KMSQ", "indicator": "sdg-ER_MRN_MARINT"}, {"value": 12.77738, "title": "Number of directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population (number)", "year": 2014, "unit": "PER_100000_POP", "indicator": "sdg-VC_DSR_DAFF"}]}
