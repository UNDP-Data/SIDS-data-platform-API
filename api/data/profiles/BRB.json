finance and business sectors are Barbados' primary sources of foreign exchange. Although sugar production was formerly a considerable contributor to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), economic diversification along with dramatic declines in soil fertility and drought in recent decades have diminished this crop's importance to the national economy. </p><p>Barbados' unemployment rate is 10 per cent, per capita income is approximately US$19,000 per year, and the island has a very high adult literacy rate of 99 per cent. </p><p>The island's climate is tropical, with annual average temperatures around 27°C.

Accordingly, the Government of Barbados has partnered with several UN agencies over the years to implement initiatives that promote social protection, gender equality, food security, and proper work name a few.
