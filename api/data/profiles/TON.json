{"developmentContext": {"title": "Development Context", "content": "<p>The Kingdom of Tonga is an archipelago consisting of four clusters of 176 total islands, 36 of which are inhabited, south of Samoa, southeast of Fiji and northeast of New Zealand; with a population of 104,494 people. Tonga is a constitutional monarchy and is unique among Pacific nations for having maintained its independence from colonial powers. Tonga is a lower middle-income country with reasonable health and education status, although rates of poverty and inequality are rising amongst the most vulnerable groups. Tonga is reliant on external income through development assistance, loans, and overseas remittances from the large Tongan diaspora. Tonga lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of dynamic geological activity. It is ranked the second most vulnerable country to natural hazards (after Vanuatu). Encircled by fringing reefs, most of the islands in Tonga originate from coralline. The majority of these islands are comparatively flat except for those raised by tectonic action. The country is predominantly rural, with around 25% of the population living in urban areas.</p><p>Environmental changes in Tonga’s coastal zones include land loss, shoreline retreat, reduced beach vegetation (including mangroves) which would otherwise act as buffers against the impacts of climate change. Much of the infrastructure and socio-economic activities in Tonga are located near or on the coast which makes them highly vulnerable to effects of sea-level rise. This has a significant impact on the country’s GDP and development in general. Water infrastructure in particular is essential to the well-being of the residents, and needs to be addressed.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Tonga’s HDI value for 2019 is 0.725— which put the country in the high human development category— positioning it at 104 out of 189 countries and territories. Between 1990 and 2019, Tonga’s HDI value increased from 0.654 to 0.725, an increase of 10.9 percent. Between 1990 and 2019, Tonga’s life expectancy at birth increased by 2.0 years, mean years of schooling increased by 2.9 years and expected years of schooling increased by 0.8 years. Tonga’s GNI per capita increased by about 50.9 percent between 1990 and 2019.</p><p>Tonga has mainstreamed the MDGs into national policies. Fiji, Tonga and Tuvalu have also improved and strengthened data systems and Tuvalu has included monitoring of vulnerable groups at the community level while the Solomon Islands has established a Development Assistance Database for improved information collection, tracking, analysis and planning services for development funds. </p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>The multiple effects of climate change pose a significant threat to the islands of Tonga, which is particularly vulnerable to storm surges and tsunami inundation. Some of Tonga’s adaptation projects include: public awareness programmes, coastal revegetation, coastal protection, expansion of water collection systems and agroforestry.</p><p>Tonga’s economy base is small, and is mainly comprised of climate-sensitive sectors such agriculture and fisheries. The country is also dependent on foreign aid. Coastal resources such as marine fisheries are vital to livelihoods of Tongans. Coral reefs, mangroves and beaches are the main environmental components of the coast which are under threat from the effects of climate change. The combination of coastal developments such as the mining of beach sand, sea level rise and extreme events caused by climate change, have led to coastal degradation.  Groundwater supplies are subject to salt-water intrusion as a result of increasing sea levels. Records suggest that there has been a general increase in sea level of 14mm/yr between 1993 and 2001. The rise in mean sea level combined with extreme weather events is likely to contribute to an increase in inundation of low-lying areas.</p><p>Tonga has a mixed record on promoting gender equality and has not ratified The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Women’s political participation is limited, with three women national Members of Parliament. Women’s work force participation is highest in the informal sector. Two out of three women report experiencing gender-based violence. In Tonga, 7.4 percent of parliamentary seats are held by women, and 94.0 percent of adult women have reached at least a secondary level of education compared to 93.4 percent of their male counterparts. Female participation in the labour market is 45.7 percent compared to 74.3 for men.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": 0.965, "title": "Gender Development Index (value)", "year": 2021, "unit": "Index", "indicator": "hdr-gdi"}, {"value": 70.9857, "title": "Life Expectancy at Birth (years)", "year": 2021, "unit": "Years", "indicator": "hdr-le"}, {"value": 0.734030017207445, "title": "GDP growth", "year": 2019, "unit": "annual %", "indicator": "wdi2-NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG"}, {"value": 4903.01213835449, "title": "GDP per capita, current US$", "year": 2019, "unit": "current US$", "indicator": "wdi2-NY.GDP.PCAP.CD"}, {"value": 37.6, "title": "Gini index", "year": 2015, "unit": "World Bank estimate", "indicator": "wdi2-SI.POV.GINI"}, {"value": 14.3, "title": "Mortality rate, infant", "year": 2019, "unit": "per 1,000 live births", "indicator": "wdi2-SP.DYN.IMRT.IN"}]}
