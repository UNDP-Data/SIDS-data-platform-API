Bahrain literally means “two seas'' in Arabic and refers to the existence of dual sources of water, naturally occurring sweetwater springs and the surrounding Gulf of Bahrain. The revenues have financed wide modernization projects, most importantly in health and education. Education in Bahrain is compulsory, and all school age children attend either public or private schools. Bahrain provides free education for all Bahraini and non-Bahraini students through the public school system.</p><p>The  economy  of  Bahrain  has  grown  by  over  6  percent  annually  since  2005,  fueled  by resurgent  oil  prices,  continued  growth  of  the  financial  sector  and  expanding  foreign investment.  The  country’s  2010  report  on  progress  towards  the  Millennium  Development Goals  (MDGs)  records  impressive  performance,  with  most  2015  targets  already  met. However, gender equality remains an issue, and despite having Bahrain two female cabinet ministers, few women occupy decision-making posts in the public or private sectors. and Women comprise only 12 percent of parliamentarians. </p><p>In addition  to  improving accountability, fostering financial management will support implementation of the National  Economic  Strategy  (NES).

In  addition  to  economic  diversification  programmes,  conservation  of  energy  to  meet  the development needs of future generations is seriously considered.
