with one main island, an outlying inlet, and 63 satellite islands and islets. Singapore is a developed country ranked ninth by Human Development Index and has the second highest GDP per capita in the world, with a population of 5.7 million people. From its history as a transshipment port, Singapore has a highly developed market economy which is considered to be innovative and dynamic, resulting in significant foreign investment, leading to a ranking as the most competitive economy by the World Economic forum. Diversification is at the heart of Singapore’s Economy with bases in finance, trade and transportation. In 2019, the industry made up approximately a quarter of the country’s GDP while the rest was covered by the services sector with service exports (mainly manufactured goods, electronics and machinery) amounting to almost twice the GDP.</p><p>Singapore supports the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It presented its first Voluntary National Review (VNR) report to the 2018 High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.  The VNR process was co-led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and took stock of progress on sustainable development. Singapore’s 2018 VNR reflects its domestic and international efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda, in particular areas such as water and sanitation and sustainable cities.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Singapore’s HDI value for 2019 is 0.938— which puts the country in the very high human development category—positioning it at 11 out of 189 countries and territories.

In that same time period, Singapore’s life expectancy at birth increased by 7.7 years, mean years of schooling increased by 5.8 years and expected years of schooling increased by 5.8 years. Singapore’s GNI per capita also increased by about 137.8 percent between 1990 and 2019. Singapore has also made strides in gender equality with  a GII value of 0.065, ranking it 12 out of 162 countries in the 2019 index. 23.0 percent of the country’s parliamentary seats are held by women, and 78.1 percent of adult women have reached at least a secondary level of education compared to 85.1 percent of their male counterparts.

Such growth will place heavier demands on limited resources, and increase the potential for pollution if development is not managed well.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": 0.939, "title": "Human Development Index (value)", "year": 2021, "unit": "Index", "indicator": "hdr-hdi"}, {"value": 0.10055, "title": "Protected marine area (Exclusive Economic Zones) (square kilometres)", "year": 2021, "unit": "KMSQ", "indicator": "sdg-ER_MRN_MARINT"}, {"value": 100.0, "title": "Proportion of population covered by at least a 4G mobile network (%)", "year": 2020, "unit": "PERCENT", "indicator": "sdg-IT_MOB_4GNTWK"}, {"value": 88088.2661463119, "title": "GNI per capita, constant 2017 international $", "year": 2017, "unit": "constant 2017 international $", "indicator": "wdi2-NY.GNP.PCAP.PP.KD"}, {"value": 22.4682651622003, "title": "Forest area, % of land area", "year": 2018, "unit": "% of land area", "indicator": "wdi-AG.LND.FRST.ZS"}, {"value": 100.0, "title": "Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking", "year": 2016, "unit": "% of population", "indicator": "wdi-EG.CFT.ACCS.ZS"}]}
