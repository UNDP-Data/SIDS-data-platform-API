It has been formally defined, by the UN General Assembly, as follows: [a] dynamic and evolving concept [that] aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social and environmental values of all types of forests, for the benefit of present and future generations\". (Resolution A/RES/62/98) An \"index of sustainable forest management\" with four sub-indicators can be used as a basic indicator of progress towards sustainable forest management by a country. The four sub-indicators are \\t1. Annual average percent change in forest area over most recent available 5 year period \\t2. Annual average percent change in stock of carbon in above ground biomass over most recent available 5 year period \\t3. Share of forest area whose primary designated function is biodiversity conservation, most recent period \\t4. Share of forest area under a forest management plan, of which forest area certified under an independent forest management certification scheme, most recent period For each of these components, countries can set national targets, monitor and report on progress. The four sub-indicators will be combined into a single composite index, but targets would be set at the level of sub-indicators. Once targets have been set by national authorities, in terms of the four sub-indicators, and progress measured over an agreed period, countries would assess progress (on track to exceed target, on track to achieve target, progress but at an insufficient rate, no significant overall progress, moving away from target). The final value of the index would be a simple arithmetic average of the values for the four sub-indicators. The use of national targets allows each country to define sustainable forest management for its own specific circumstances, within a coherent international framework. Targets on the sub-indicators can also be set at regional or global levels.", "name": "Proportion of forest area with a long-term management plan (%)", "source": "FAO, Global Forest Resources Assessment", "dataset": "sdg", "category": "SDG 15", "subcategory": "Target 15.2", "link": "https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/", "dim": "None", "priority": "2.0", "units": "PERCENT"}}
