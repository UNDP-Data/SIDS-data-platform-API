Interviewees will have to provide a \\'yes\\' answer to all three questions in order to count as a woman who makes her own sexual and reproductive decisions. The first question looks at the ability to say no to sexual intercourse as a critical condition of sexual autonomy. The second question measures the woman\\'s decision concerning using or not using contraception. The third question measures the woman\\'s decision about reaching sexual and reproductive healthcare for her. The three questions are as follows: \\t1. Whether a woman can say no to her husband/partner if she does not want to have sexual intercourse (DHS q. 1054) \\t2. Whether using contraception or not using contraception has been mainly the woman\\'s decision (DHS phase 7 q. 819 and 820) \\t3. Whether a woman can make a decision about sexual and reproductive healthcare for herself (DHS q.922 with added language)  From UNFPA:  The indicator is based on three central elements measuring the empowerment of women (married, in union and ever sexually active women) aged 15-49 to make the following decisions, : (a) whether they are able to reject unwanted sexual relations; (b) using or not using contraception; and (c) whether they can access sexual and reproductive health care for herself.", "name": "Proportion of women who make their own informed decisions regarding reproductive health care (% of women aged 15-49 years)", "source": "UNFPA Global Database, 2022.", "dataset": "sdg", "category": "SDG 5", "subcategory": "Target 5.6", "link": "https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/", "dim": "FEMALE, 15-49", "priority": "2.0", "units": "PERCENT"}}
