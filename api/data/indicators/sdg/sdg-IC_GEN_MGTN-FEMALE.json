Some of these data are already collected while others need further development. For example, UN Women routinely collects data on women Heads of State and Government; the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) regularly collects data on the proportion of women ministers and in parliaments; indicators on women in law enforcement are also readily available; and ILO regularly publishes data on women managers using data from national labour force surveys. Data on women\\'s political participation at the local level have not been as systematically collected at the global level. Measuring women\\'s participation in local government is important, however, because of the responsibilities of local governments and the significantly higher number of opportunities (that is, seats) available to women candidates at this level. To measure women\\'s representation in local governments, methodologies and standards are currently being developed by UN Women and United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG).", "name": "Proportion of women in senior and middle management positions (%)", "source": "HIES - Living Conditions Survey", "dataset": "sdg", "category": "SDG 5", "subcategory": "Target 5.5", "link": "https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/", "dim": "FEMALE", "priority": "2.0", "units": "PERCENT"}}
