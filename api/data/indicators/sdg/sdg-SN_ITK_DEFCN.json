It is written as: ______ = \\' __(__)____ __<________ where f(x) is the probability density function of per capita calorie consumption and MDER is a Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement. The MDER threshold is computed on the basis of normative energy requirement standards referred to a minimum level of physical activity. Estimates of the number of undernourished (NoU) - calculated by multiplying the PoU by the size of the reference population - are used to monitor progress towards the World Food Summit goal of reducing by half the number of people suffering from undernourishment. The parameters needed for the calculation of the indicator are: the mean level of dietary energy consumption (DEC); a cut-off point defined as the Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement (MDER); the coefficient of variation (CV) as a parameter accounting for inequality in food consumption; and a skewedness (SK) parameter accounting for asymmetry in the distribution. The DEC as well as the MDER are updated annually, with the former calculated from the FAO Food Balance Sheets. The MDER is calculated as a weighted average of energy requirements according to sex and age class, and is updated each year from UN population ratio data. The inequality in food consumption parameters are derived from National Household Survey data when such data is available and reliable. Due to the limited number of available household surveys, the inequality in food access parameters are updated much less frequently over time than the DEC and MDER parameters.", "name": "Number of undernourish people (millions)", "source": "FAO, Statistics Division", "dataset": "sdg", "category": "SDG 2", "subcategory": "Target 2.1", "link": "https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/", "dim": "None", "priority": "2.0", "units": "NUM_M"}}
