as a percentage of total (Tier 1 \\' part of Minimum set of gender indicators) \\t\\tNumber of leadership positions held by women in local governments as a percentage of total (Tier 3) \\tin the legislative branch of government: \\t\\tNumber of seats in national parliaments held by women as a percentage of total (Tier 1 \\' part of Minimum set of gender indicators) \\tin the judiciary branch

of total (Tier 2 \\' part of Minimum set of gender indicators) ; and \\tthe share of managers in public and private sector enterprises that are women (Tier 1 \\' part of Minimum set of gender indicators). Some of these data are already collected while others need further development. For example, UN Women routinely collects data on women Heads of State and Government; the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) regularly collects data on the proportion of women ministers and in parliaments; indicators on women in law enforcement are also readily available; and ILO regularly publishes data on women managers using data from national labour force surveys. Data on women\\'s political participation at the local level have not been as systematically collected at the global level. Measuring women\\'s participation in local government is important, however, because of the responsibilities of local governments and the significantly higher number of opportunities (that is, seats) available to women candidates at this level. To measure women\\'s representation in local governments, methodologies and standards are currently being developed by UN Women and United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG).", "name": "Proportion of women in managerial positions (%)", "source": "ILO modelled estimates, November 2020, available in ILOSTAT (https://ilostat.ilo.org/).
