The Standard Material Transfer Agreement (SMTA) is a mandatory contract that Parties to the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (International Treaty) have agreed to use whenever plant genetic resources falling under the Treaty\\'s Access and Benefit-sharing mechanism are made available. The SMTA defines the conditions of use of the plant genetic resources as well as the benefitsharing conditions. According to the SMTA providers shall inform the Governing Body about the Standard Material Transfer Agreements entered into. In addition, recipients who transfer resources received under a SMTA to third parties shall do so under the terms and conditions of the SMTA and shall notify the Governing Body. SMTAs are stored in the Data Store of the International Treaty. As of 21 August 2015, the Data Store has recorded 34,898 SMTAs from providers located in 30 countries, distributing material to recipients based in 172 countries.
