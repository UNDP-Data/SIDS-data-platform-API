The monetary value of total or partial destruction of physical assets existing in the affected area. Examples include loss to physical assets such as damaged housings, factories and infrastructure. Direct losses usually happen during the event or within the first few hours after the event and are often assessed soon after the event to estimate recovery cost and claim insurance payments. These are tangible and relatively easy to measure. Direct Economic loss in this indicator framework consists of agriculture loss, damage to industrial and commercial facilities, damage to housings and critical infrastructures. \\tWe limit the economic loss into direct economic loss, excluding indirect loss (e.g. loss due to interrupted production) and macro-economic loss. The reason is that there is not yet universally standardized methodology to measure indirect and macro-economic loss while direct loss data monitoring is relatively simpler and more standardized. Global gross domestic product: Summation of GDP of Countries. GDP definition according to the World Bank. Hazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence of a hazard. Hazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. UNISDR recommends setting NO threshold for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community. These events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is \"the risk of small-scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks\". Regarding the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events including epidemics. However, we generally do not expect biological disasters will cause physical damages to facilities. ). \\tNote: Terminology will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.", "name": "Direct economic loss in the housing sector attributed to disasters (current United States dollars)", "source": "United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (2022)", "dataset": "sdg", "category": "SDG 1", "subcategory": "Target 1.5", "link": "https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/", "dim": "None", "priority": "2.0", "units": "CU_USD"}}
