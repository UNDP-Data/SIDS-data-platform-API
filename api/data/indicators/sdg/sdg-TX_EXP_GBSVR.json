Alternatively, and in order to reflect the dual purpose of the target (i.e. increase of developing countries exports / doubling the LDCs share for global exports) 2 different indicators can be calculated out of the same data, namely: (1) least developed countries\\' share of global exports (in % terms), (2) exports of developing countries (in value terms). The indicator will not include export of oil and arms. From UPU:  Developing countries and LDCs\\' e-commerce flows at the export level (volumes and/or values, and by product): this indicator would be a volume or value index of international e-commerce flows from developing countries and LDCs to the rest of the world.
